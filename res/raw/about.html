<h2>Microphone</h2>
<p>This microphone simply sends your voice out of the phone, causing a horrible screeching feedback noise WHICH POPS YOUR SPEAKER! 
But wait, that's not all! If you have a male-to-male <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/offer-listing/B001NXQR0K?ie=UTF8&tag=bitplanenet-21&linkCode=am2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B001NXQR0K">3.5mm headphone jack</a> you can plug your phone into your computer, 
PA system or whatever and use your Android device as a real microphone.</p>

<p>If you're thinking it's not a very good mic, you're right. It's currently not possible to access the mic's input stream in a lag
free way, this might be fixed in Android 3.0 but until then this is as good as it gets. No good for karaoke, but still useful for voice chat.</p>

<p>This is an early release so it's very simple at the moment and doesn't include volume, gain or anything fancy like that. It also hasn't been tested on
older phones. Stay tuned for updates!</p>
